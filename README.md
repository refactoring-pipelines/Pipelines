## Pipelines

Pipelines are a mechanism of separating a function that produces something into two things: 
    - an object that represents the process of that function (the "pipeline") 
    - executing that pipeline to produce the result

The advantage of doing this is that the pipeline is easy to test, easy to visualize, and easy to modify globally such as adding logging or converting to async.

This library also allows for simple, small-step transformations to incrementally refactor existing procedural code, making it practical to do in your current production code.
